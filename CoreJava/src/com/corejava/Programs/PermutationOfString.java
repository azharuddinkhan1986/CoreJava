 * Permutation of String in Java Algorithm

To get all the permutations, we will first take out the first char from String and permute the remaining chars.
If String = “ABC”
First char = A and remaining chars permutations are BC and CB.
Now we can insert first char in the available positions in the permutations.
BC -> ABC, BAC, BCA
CB -> ACB, CAB, CBA

So we can write a recursive function call to return the permutations and then another function call to insert the first characters to get the complete list of permutations.
